tutorial8 = "Press [G] then hold [M] for a quick start with the Mach Run! Try it out!"
tutorial9 = "You can also jump after pressing [G] in order to do a long jump!"
tutorial10 = "You can also simply run up a slope next to a wall to automatically start wall running!"

tutorial12 = "Release [D] and keep holding [M] to continue the Mach Run!"

tutorial19 = "After starting a Super Jump, you can also dash forward in the air by pressing [G]! Give it a try!"
tutorial20 = "Another trick: Press [G] then [D] immediately to go through gaps faster!"
tutorial21 = "You can grab things with the Grab Dash and throw them by pressing [G] again!"
tutorial22 = "If you hold [U] before throwing, you will send the things up!"
tutorial23 = "Collect these in order to get a better rank! Some can only be acquired during the escape..."

hubtips4 = "Be wary of your final judgement. Your performance is always accounted for."
hubtips5 = "Once you have beaten a level, you can revisit it to find a Lap 2 portal near the entrance. These will give you a point bonus, but also force you to loop around the escape portion one more time..."
hubtips6 = "Did you know that you can do a piledriver by holding an enemy and pressing [D] while in the air ? You can also perform a piledriver that will boost you upward if you hold [U] before grabbing an enemy."
hubtips7 = "An obscure technique: While doing a dive in the air and pressing [J], you will directly go downward with a body slam. Only useful if you want to save time!"
hubtips8 = "Did you know that you can make enemies react to you faster by pressing [T] near them?"
hubtips9 = "The elusive P rank... You can get it by doing everything there is to do in a level. The problem is that you need to keep a combo for the entirety of the level! It's a tough challenge, so don't feel bad if you don't want to do it!"

Well, we're down from your pizzeria, and we're down from this tower. There are customers, and they want to see one of these things. So I got a friend, he went down one of the floors and this guy came up next to me, and the idea was, why is it that when you're in the upper part of the tower there is this Pizzaface character, then there's a man from your previous life leading the way? There's a pizza in your tower with all this information."
garbage7 = "Pizza Tower Instant Pizza Gaming Promotion! Type /pizza to order a free pizza courtesy of Peppino's Pizza!"
